#Iris Dataset Exploration in R

**It performs various tasks including:**

1. Loading libraries: It loads the datasets library to access the Iris data.
2. Head: It displays the first few rows of the data to get a glimpse of the features.
3. Summary: It summarizes the data, providing information about the data types and basic statistics for each feature (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width) and the target variable (Species).
4. Histograms: It creates histograms to visualize the distribution of Petal Length for each Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) and allows for filtering based on specific petal length ranges.
5. Data Subsetting: It demonstrates how to subset the data based on specific conditions, such as selecting rows where Petal Length is less than a certain value or belongs to a specific species.
6. Viewing Data: It utilizes the View function to open the data in a separate window for easier exploration.
7. Data Types: It explores the data types of variables (numeric, character, logical) and demonstrates how to convert them if needed.
8. Factors: It introduces the concept of factors, which are categorical variables, and shows how to convert them with specific levels and labels.
9. Sequences: It demonstrates creating sequences of numbers for various purposes, such as generating a range of values or repeating specific values.
10. Loading Data from Files: It showcases loading data from CSV and TXT files using different libraries (rio and base R functions like read.csv and read.table).
11. Hierarchical Clustering: It performs hierarchical clustering on a subset of the Iris data and visualizes the resulting dendrogram. The code allows for highlighting clusters with different numbers of groups.
12. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): It performs PCA to reduce dimensionality and explores the results. This includes obtaining summary statistics, visualizing the explained variance by each component, and examining how the data points project onto the principal components.
13. Linear Regression: It demonstrates building a linear regression model to predict a continuous target variable based on several predictor variables. It shows how to obtain coefficients, summaries, and assess model performance.
14. Stepwise Regression: It introduces different stepwise regression techniques like stepwise, forward stepwise, and LASSO for variable selection in linear regression models.
15. Housing Price Prediction (Incomplete Example): It starts exploring a housing dataset but is incomplete. It demonstrates loading the data, handling missing values, and calculating correlations between features.
    This code provides a basic introduction to data exploration and analysis in R using the Iris dataset. It covers various functionalities and serves as a starting point for further exploration of these techniques.
